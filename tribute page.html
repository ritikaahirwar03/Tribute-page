            <p>Serena Williams is an American professional tennis player.She has been ranked singles world No. 1 by the
                Women's Tennis Association (WTA) for 319 weeks, including a joint-record 186 consecutive weeks, and
                finished as the year-end No. 1 five times.</p>
            <p>Along with her older sister Venus, Serena Williams was coached by her parents Oracene Price and Richard
                Williams. Turning professional in 1995, she won her first major singles title at the 1999 US Open. From
                the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian Open, she was dominant, winning all four major singles
                titles (each time over Venus in the final) to achieve a non-calendar year Grand Slam and the career
                Grand Slam, known as the "Serena Slam". Williams returned to dominance, claiming Olympic gold and
                becoming the first tennis player to achieve a Career Golden Slam in both singles and doubles.</p>

            <h1>Off court activities</h1>
            <hr>
            <h2>Fashion</h2>
            <p>Williams has been noted for her unusual and colorful outfits on court. In 2002, there was much talk when
                she wore a black lycra catsuit at the US Open.Since 2004, she has also run her own line of designer
                apparel, "Aneres"â€”her first name spelled backward. In 2009, she launched a signature collection of
                handbags and jewelry.In Fall 2019, Williams launched the first collection of her sustainable clothing
                line, S by Serena.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Activism</h2>
            <p>Williams has become more involved in social change as her career has progressed, primarily using social
                media as a medium of expressing her views.Also in 2016, Serena Williams wrote an open letter in Porter
                Magazine's "Incredible Women of 2016" to speak out about gender equality and her personal struggles as a
                woman in tennis. She noted that women's contributions to the sport of tennis are not recognized in
                the way men's contributions are recognized; she also called out issues of equal pay in tennis. She ended
                the letter stating that she hoped that her letter would inspire a new generation of women to "push for
                greatness and follow their dreams with steadfast resilience."</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Charity Work</h2>
            <p>In 2004 and 2005, Serena and her sister, Venus, visited hospitals and played several tennis matches in
                predominantly black cities to raise money for the local Ronald McDonald House charities. An ESPN episode
                was dedicated to the Williams sisters' charity tour.The Serena Williams Foundation also provides
                university scholarships for underprivileged students in the United States.</p>
